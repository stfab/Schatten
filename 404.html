<div class="page">
  <h1 class="page-title">404: Page not found</h1>
  <p>Sorry, but the page you were trying to view does not exist.</p>
  <p>It looks like this was the result of either:<br>
    1. a mistyped address<br>
    2. an out-of-date link</p>
  <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/" class="btn">Go to Home Page</a>
</div>
