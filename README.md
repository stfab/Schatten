## Attribution

This theme is based on [Len Paul's theme Lagrange](https://github.com/LeNPaul/Lagrange) published under the MIT License. In order to implement more features and add my own style, I developed this theme.

## Intention

Schatten's original goal is to offer the following features:

  * Compatiblity with GitHub Pages
  * SEO features
  * SASS/SCSS support
  * Responsive design
  * Modern UI with e.g. dark mode
  * Configurable code themes

## Contributing/Feature Requests

If you would like to make a feature request or report a bug or typo in the documentation,submit a GitHub issue. To contribute, create a fork of this repo and make a pull request from a new feature branch to the official repo's main branch. 

Bug fixing is always welcome, for feature requests please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to add. Since the goal of this theme is to be minimalistic, I do not intend to make it feature rich.
